# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description
Was given a deployable but non operational employee payroll tracker. The goal was to add to the incomplete Javascript get it to function as follows. When I click the "Add employee" button, I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary. When I finish adding an employee then I am prompted to continue or cancel. When I choose to continue then I am prompted to add a new employee. When I choose to cancel, then my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data. The motive behind this project is to challenge myself and use all of my accuired knowledge thus far to complete this payroll tracker.
